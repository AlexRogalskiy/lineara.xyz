      1) The graffiti were written on the east well (as stated 
explicitly by Stefani, and implicitly by Paribeni, when he says that they were written by a man seated on the lowest step of the staircase along the 
East wall)
      <p>
       2) at a rather low level, perhaps 20 or maximum 40 cm high (both for  
what I said before and because they were painted on the dark ground, that 
is to say on the dark dado or the above red band (both around 20 cm high) 
which decorated this wall (pace Cameron 1965, who states that HT 156 
should be at eye-level or at the level of a seated person due to a 
probable beam (?) impression)
      </p>
      <p>
       3) before the decoration was made, if Cameron 1965 is right in saying 
that the paint had washed in the graffito.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The three inscriptions (HT Zd 155, 156, 157) should be written as a 
sequence, not the one above the other, since there was no space for such a 
disposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sequence in the notebook 1903 is HT 157, 156, 155, exactly the  
opposite of the order of publication.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, Stefani, describing Room 54, says that 2 inscriptions were 
found. This statement lets me think that two of these inscriptions should 
be written in sequence, so that they could be considered as  only one 
inscription.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only candidates are HT 157 and 156, or HT 156 and 155

       JGY: since 
157 has considerable space to the left of the inscription and its 
signgroup ends near the right break in the plaster; and since 156 begins 
at the left break of the plaster and has a small space at the right break; 
these two inscriptions should then form one inscription.
       <br/>
       Inscription 155 has a short space at the left and right edges of the plaster.

      <p>
       So, I suggest the 3 inscriptions were written along a roughly single line, starting with HT 157 to the North, immediately followed by HT 156, 
and ending with HT 155.
