 (HM 3557) 
(GORILA V: 18-19), square Libation Table, serpentine, with 5 
facets per side and one at each corner, making 24 facets in all. Line 1 
goes all the way around the Table, 
its signs being placed one in a facet, its first sign placed in the first  
facet of side a
just after the left corner (whose facet contains the last sign, MA). The 
signs of Line 2 do 
not go all the way around the table; they start below the beginning of 
line 1 and end somewhere on side c or at the beginning of side d; these 
signs
are placed more or less below the ridges that divide the facets above.
Line 1, therefore, should contain 
24 signs; line 2 contained 13-26 signs. Word divisions in line 1 are on 
the ridges separating facets. Holes were drilled part-way 
through the corners, perhaps to hold a lid or some vertical attachments 
(cf. KN Za 10).

  Line 1 has all signs perfectly placed. Line 
2 is problematic, but probably ended with a word of 6 signs, the first of 
which is I- (for the second sign, GORILA reads DA, but it could be 
something else). In the attached illustration, JGY hypothesizes a 
word-divider on side d between -NA-SI • and I-PI-NA-; on the other 
sides word-dividers are placed exactly in the center of the ridges 
dividing the niches. On side d, the 3rd ridge from the left corner is 
preserved well enough that it is possible that it carried no word-divider.
