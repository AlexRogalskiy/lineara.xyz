  the number: two horizontal strokes (
  <b>
   20
  </b>
  ) are followed by two 
lightly incised vertical strokes(
  <b>
   2
  </b>
  ). The two sets of numbers may 
explain the logogram. The circle with two dots looks similar to Cretan 
Hieroglyphic signs *074 (with two internal dots) and *075 (with three 
dots) on Knossos bar #053; there, the two signs obviously function as 
collectives for 20 and 30 commodities, apparently BOS (bovines). If the 
circle with two dots on GO Wc 3 is also a collective, i.e., 20, that 
would explain the added two horizontal strokes, clarifying that the two 
vertical strokes refer to the two dots in the circle, but since these 
are actually tens, the scribe added the two horizontal strokes to refer 
to the collective 20.
