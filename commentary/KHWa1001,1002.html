   The two sealings present the same inscription, but GORILA presents 
it in two different ways. GORILA III, 104, prints out      
signs *08-*67-*01-*60 (A-KI-DA-RO). But GORILA IV, 248 and 296, notes the 
more solid shape 
of the double-ax sign and transcribes it as *317
   <img height="20" src="./commentary/images/A317.jpg"/>
   ; and, since each 
pair of syllables is on a separate side of the sealing and 
therefore consists of one large and one smaller sign to fit in the 
small space, GORILA IV presents each pair as a ligature: *317+KI 
(*640   on side a) DA+RO (*501   on side g). Ligature *640 may 
occur also on KH 7a.1, but the reading is doubtful. On the two 
sealings, the double ax sign's two horizontal lines are long, 
continuous, and curved, cut through by the vertical hasta as the 
last line drawn. Sign *317   occurs on three (other) documents, as 
a logogram only. On ARKH 3a.3 and 5, the horizontals are short and 
straight with the vertical lines at either end extending above and 
below. On HT 96a.3, the sign looks exactly like a speared box, very 
neatly drawn. And on PH 9a, it looks exactly like the speared box 
on HT 96a.3 but on its side, with the hasta to the right. In other 
words, the double ax sign on the sealings, with its curved 
horizontals, does not look like the (other) examples of *317 or the 
common, abstract and linear versions of *08. Instead, it has 
affinities with other renderings of *08 A that refer more 
artistically to the solid and curved blades of the double: HT 88.1 
has *08 with two horizontal lines very close together ending in 
curved vertical blade ends (cf. the curved blade ends on HT 126a.1 
and the close pair of horizontals on PK Za 4, Za 12). The sign's 
more sculptural counterparts are seen in KO Za 1.a, c (GORILA IV); 
and IO Za 2a.1, Za 3, and Za 7 (GORILA V).
