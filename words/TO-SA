]to-sa pu2-re-ja[ (PK Za 16)  
V. Hicks reads the inscription on the corner of a libation table as follows: ‘so many (tosa, cf. Greek tossos) offerings or things brought (pu2reja, from the zero grade of PIE *bher- which would yield an o in Greek phoros). If ἡ φυλία ‘wild olive’ might be taken into consideration then ‘so many olives’ might be proposed as a thanslation of the word combination, cf. SY Za 2 ja-su-ma-tu OLIV and u-na-ka-na-si OLE.
